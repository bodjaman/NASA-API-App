# Only Curious - NASA API Project

_Only Curious_ takes a user-input date and renders all of the photographs taken by NASA's Curiosity Rover on that date.

I used a [NASA Open API](https://api.nasa.gov/) maintained by [Chris Cerami](https://github.com/chrisccerami/mars-photo-api).

The project is deployed with Netlify, take a look [here](https://nostalgic-newton-cbe80a.netlify.app/)!

I'd like to:

- Have the camera name appear on mouse-hover
- Set a range for the input, so that users cannot pick a date prior to Curiosity's landing on Mars
- Find (if possible) a neater way to remove one set of images and render another set
- Have the most recent set of images, or a single random image render before any input
- Add more styling and tidy up the CSS (it's a mess since I converted this to a React app...)
