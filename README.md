# NASA Curiosity Rover Images - API Project

This website takes a randomly generated Earth date between Curiosity's landing on 6 August 2012 and the current date and displays all of the images taken by the rover. On refresh, a new random date is generated and a new set of images is displayed!

I used a [NASA Open API](https://api.nasa.gov/) maintained by [Chris Cerami](https://github.com/chrisccerami/mars-photo-api).

The project is deployed with Netlify, take a look [here](https://nostalgic-newton-cbe80a.netlify.app/).

I'd like to improve it in the following ways:

- Have the images change according to a date selected by the user
- Have the camera name appear on mouse-hover
